# 🎧 Fresh Beats Business Intelligence Report

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of Business Intelligence (BI) with TripleTen. As a BI Analyst, I’ve taken a first step by analyzing real business data to generate actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations to address real-world business challenges faced by **Fresh Beats** — a vibrant and innovative online music streaming platform.
Fresh Beats not only delivers music to fans but also empowers emerging artists through its unique promotional model. The goal of this project was to evaluate the platform’s performance and uncover opportunities to enhance artist visibility, improve user engagement, and optimize genre promotion.
