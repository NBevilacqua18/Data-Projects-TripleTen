# 📄 Contextual Requirements Document
## 🧑‍🎓 Analyst Role
- Junior Business Intelligence Analyst
---
## ✅ Project Title
- **Zuber Ride-Sharing Analysis – Sprint 2: Data Collection and Storage (SQL)**
---
## 🎯 Project Context and Objective
- Completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Program**, Sprint 2.
- The project simulates a real-world data analysis scenario at **Zuber**, a new ride-sharing startup launching in **Chicago**.
- Objective: Analyze external and internal factors that impact ride-sharing activity, using structured SQL queries on a relational database.
- This sprint emphasized the importance of **data collection, storage, and querying** for business decision-making.
---
## 🏢 Company Background – Zuber
- Zuber is entering the Chicago market as a **ride-sharing competitor**.
- It needs to understand taxi usage patterns, market competition, and external influences (like weather) on ride demand and duration.
- Gaining data-driven insights is crucial for optimizing launch strategy, operations, and pricing.
---
## 🗃️ Data Source and Structure
- The analysis used a relational database consisting of four main tables:
  - `neighborhoods`: Mapping of neighborhood IDs to names
  - `cabs`: Taxi vehicle data and associated company
  - `trips`: All historical taxi ride data (timestamps, distance, locations)
  - `weather_records`: Hourly weather snapshots including temperature and descriptions
- No direct link between `trips` and `weather_records`; JOIN operations were performed based on timestamp alignment (`start_ts = ts`).
---
## 📅 Timeline
- Sprint Duration: ~15–30 minutes of active SQL querying, after lessons were completed.
- Completion Date: **December 2024**
---
## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Demonstrated ability to work with normalized databases using SQL.
- Gained experience interpreting business questions and writing corresponding queries.
- Practiced joining datasets from multiple tables using logical keys and timestamps.
- Built confidence in transforming raw data into **strategic business insights**.
