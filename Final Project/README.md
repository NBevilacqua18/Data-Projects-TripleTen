# 🍽️ Zomato Business Intelligence Report
## 🚀 Project Overview
This final project marks the culmination of my **Business Intelligence (BI)** journey with **TripleTen**. As a **Junior BI Analyst**, I took on an onboarding assignment for **Zomato**, a global restaurant aggregator and food delivery company.
The objective was to apply all the BI skills acquired throughout the program to a real-world business case. I analyzed **customer behavior** on the Zomato platform, focusing on **segmentation** and **purchasing patterns**, to deliver actionable insights to improve customer engagement and retention strategies.
This project involved **decomposition (planning)**, **dashboard creation**, and a **report with conclusions and recommendations**, mirroring the workflow of a fundamental BI analyst in the field.
